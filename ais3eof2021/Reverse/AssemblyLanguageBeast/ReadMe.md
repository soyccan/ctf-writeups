WOW, a reversing challenge with source code ! Fantastic !

Oh, this the the final project for assembly language course when I was sophomore, so the  code is quite messy ><

**The source of this challenge has slightly different to their equivalent on  github  (about 79 LOC),  the flag is in STATE_FLAG ;)**
