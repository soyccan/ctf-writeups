Name: Zero Storage (FLAG A)
Value: 0
Description: 1. There are two flags in this challenge. Flag A is in admin's uploaded file, and Flag B is admin's password. Note that the two flags are independent. You can get either flag without the other one.
2. The source code is attached. Except for `zerostorage/app/server.py`, there is no intended vulnerability in this challenge, so basically just readling `server.py` is sufficient to get the two flags.
3. Enjoy the challenge! http://zero-storage-eof-ctf.csie.org:1310/
