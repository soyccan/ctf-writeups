# Task Name
SecDES - Rev 100


# Task Description
We designed a SecDES algorithm, a secure DES variant.
It's time to make DES great again!!!


We have two intended solutions for this challenge.
If you think there are too few modern cryptography challenges in this CTF and feel bored,
here's another one :)
There are some interesting cryptographic properties which can help you solve this challenge faster.
