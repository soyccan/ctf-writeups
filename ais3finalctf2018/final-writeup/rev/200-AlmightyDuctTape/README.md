# Task Name
Almighty Duct Tape - Rev 200


# Task Description
Dear challenger,

Thank you for choosing Unreliable Parcel Service.
We're glad to be of service to you.

Your package has been arrived. Pick it up from [here](http://downloadlink).
However, we are sorry to inform you that your package got broken in transit.
One of our courier accidentally dropped your package to the ground.
Unluckily, your flag checker was shattered into hundreds of fragments.

We made our best efforts to repair it, seriously.
We collected all the fragments in your parcel and tried to bond them with almighty duct tape.
It looks a little bit weird, but it seems to be working.

Sorry for your inconvience.

### Hints
* The only obfuscation applied is shattering.
* If you have never heared of TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm),
I suggest googling it after you defeat our obfuscation.
There's a modified TEA variant in the program.
