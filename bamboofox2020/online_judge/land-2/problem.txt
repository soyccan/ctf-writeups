Oh!! You can only ask 59 times. Can you still solve this problem?

http://34.82.101.212:10005/tasks/Level2/submissions Please use your username and password on ctfd to login the Judge Server.

Remote Server: Ubuntu 18.04

After you solved this challenge, the next level will be auto released.

This is a programming contest problem. And the problem type is Special Judge. Please read the statement.pdf for problem detail. The release.zip is some code for you to let you can test on your own computer. The grader.c in release.zip is different from the judge server's grader.c, but all the global variable in grader.c is still in the judge server's grader.c. Your goal is to write a C code and submit it to the system to get Accepted. If you get Accepted, then you can get the Flag. Please don't attack the Judge System. But you can attack the problem by your C code. You must wait for 2 minute between every submission.
