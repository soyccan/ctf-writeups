Description: Recently, I was playing MAX7219 LED dot matrix and I had record a video.
There are three features inside the video, try to find out these three features and figure out the flag with them!

In order to reduce the difficulty, I give you  a hint for one of the features:<br>
- Each time it light up various numbers of columns of light, record them.

okay.. I'll give you other two hints.
- Long exposure photography may help?
- It seems that the lighting frequency is not constant.

The answer should be put in BALSN{......} format.
